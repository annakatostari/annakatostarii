            <h3>~ A short tour of the narrow streets of Piraeus! ~</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
                 Τhe word Piraeus comes from the ancient Greek language and means passage.
                According to research, the area was an island and was separated from Attica by
                Lagoon.In ancient times, Piraeus was one of the three municipalities of the alliance
                of Hercules. The municipalities of Piraeus, Keratsini and Nice had a common sanctuary
                dedicated to the mythical hero Hercules. The strategic importance of the area
                recognized by the general Themistocles after the victory in her Naval Battle
                Salamis in 480 BC.Themistocles is the one who will want Piraeus to be fortified and become the most important port of the time.
                The walls and many monuments of the area were demolished during the siege of the Roman general Sulla.
                While later Gothic clans will plunder the area leading to desertification.Piraeus changes administrations and names, the Venetians will call it Porto Leone,
                the Byzantines port of the Dragon, the Turks Aslan Liman and the newly established Greek state in 1835 will return it to its ancient name: Piraeus.
                In its newer history, Piraeus will host a large number of refugees from
                A world war and will organize vigorous resistance during itSecond PP, it will become a symbol of industrial development and urban progress,
                With an abundance of neoclassical houses and architectural wonders of the 20th century, Piraeus
                Of the 21st century welcomes millions of visitors as the largest port of the country.</p>

            <h4>~ The Trumpet of Piraeus! ~</h4>
                 <p class="fst-italic">
                    Perhaps the most misunderstood area of ​​Piraeus' recent history.
                    The area got its name from the pump that was placed in a well from 1860, at the beginning of Aigeos Street, (today's 2nd Division) and supplied water to the ships.
                    In the 1950s and 1960s, Troumba experienced the so-called "golden age" which lasted for about 20 years.
                    The architecture of the houses favored the creation of brothels as well as the notorious cabarets that left an era,
                    such as 'John Bull' and 'Black Cat'.At the same time, Troumba maintained its popular heritage and flourished
                    musically creating a unique sound in the world: Rebetiko.
                    The great rebetes worked great, Markos Vamvakaris, Papaioannou, Keromytis and Nikos Pounentis,
                    they played music that was later admired by musical minds such as Jimmy Hendrix.In 1967, all activities in the area were banned.
                    A rereading of history today credits the region with both the flourishing and consolidation of folk music and
                    and for her resistance action against
                    World War 2. (see bibliography).

                <h4>~ Archaeological Museum of Piraeus! ~</h4>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                    The Archaeological Museum of Piraeus offers the visitor a representative and complete picture of the history of the city, which during antiquity 
                    experienced great prosperity both as a commercial center of the eastern Mediterranean and as a naval station of ancient Athens.                      
                    The type of exhibits, which come mainly from the wider area of ​​Piraeus and the Attica beach,
                    and the time limits they cover, from the Mycenaean to the Roman era,
                    they are representative of the peculiarity, the composition of the population and the history of Piraeus.
                    The museum's collections consist mainly of excavation finds or accidental finds and of antiquities traditions,
                    while they have also been enriched by donations from private collections,
                    such as the Meletopoulos-Nomidou collection and, more recently, the Geroulanos Collection.
                    The museum is housed in a two-story building, which flanks the Hellenistic theater of Zea on the west and south sides and has a total area of ​​1,394 sq.m.
                    Its exhibition spaces occupy ten rooms on two floors (1,044 sq.m.).
                    The old museum building (330 sq.m.), located right next door, is currently used as a sculpture warehouse,
                    while in the archaeological site of the theater of Zea, an open-air exhibition of sculptures will be held.

<h4>~ Marina Zeas ~</h4>
    <p class="fst-italic">
        Marina Zeas is located in Piraeus, on the east coast of the Piraeus peninsula. 
        The sea area consists of two ports, Pasalimani and Freatida. 
        Compared to other marinas, the traffic here is more increased thanks to the many shops in the marina and the surrounding area.
        In ancient times it was the largest military port of Athens. The area in front of Kanari square could accommodate
        Double ships while it is estimated that almost the entire fleet of Athens was kept there.
        Marina Zeas is, among others, an ideal spot for a walking route, as along the way the visitor has the opportunity to enjoy the view of the sea and the sky.
        The bustling marina offers multiple dining options
        and international cuisines. Here you have the opportunity to try Italian, Mexican, Asian and American flavors.
